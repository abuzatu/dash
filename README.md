# Intro

Created by Adrian Buzatu on 20 Dec 2020 with tutorials and simple examples of how to use Dash to build a web analytics application in Python, without JavaScript. It can include any other `html` element (like a `Folium map`) in our dashboard. 

Code examples: [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-dash-in-python/), [Medium](https://medium.com/@shachiakyaagba_41915/integrating-folium-with-dash-5338604e7c56).
